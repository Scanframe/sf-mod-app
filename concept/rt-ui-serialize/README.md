# Qt UI-Form Serializing

This is a proof of concept that UI elements on a form can be serialized to a file
and be recreated by reading by the same file at runtime.

The Qt UI-form from the QT-Designer is an XML-file which is precompiled to C++ 
which is then compiled into the application.

The main question is are: 
* What is already there in Qt?
* What is needed to serialize a UI-form at runtime?
